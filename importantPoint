==> Difference Between Node.js and Express.js
    Node.js -->> Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing 
                JavaScript code outside of a browser. 
                Node.js is not a programming language and it is also not a function.
    Express.js -->> Express is a small framework that sits on top of Nodejs's web server functionality
                to simplify its API and helful new features.

==> What is Express ?
    Express has a lot of features built in, and a lot more features you can get from other packages 
    that integrate seamlessly, but there are three main things it does for you out of the box:

    -->> Routing: This is how /home /blog and /about all give you different pages. Express makes it
    easy for you to modularize this code by allowing you to put different routes in different files.
    -->> Middleware: If you’re new to the term, basically middleware is “software glue”. It accesses 
    requests before your routes get them, allowing them to handle hard-to-do stuff like cookie parsing, 
    file uploads, errors, and more.
    -->> Views. Views are how HTML pages are rendered with custom content. You pass in the data you want 
    to be rendered and Express will render it with your given view engine.
